    <h1><i><u>Introduction to JavaScript</u></i></h1>
    <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular and powerful programming languages used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It was originally developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 for adding small scripts to web pages, but today it has become a full-fledged language used in both frontend and backend development.

   JavaScript runs directly in the browser, allowing developers to create engaging features such as animations, pop-ups, sliders, forms, and interactive buttons. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the web.

   In modern development, JavaScript is not limited to the browser only — it is also used on the server side through Node.js, in mobile apps, and even in desktop applications. Its vast ecosystem, including libraries like React, Vue, and Angular, makes it one of the most versatile languages in the world.

   In short, JavaScript brings life and interactivity to websites and applications, making the web a more dynamic and user-friendly place.</p>
